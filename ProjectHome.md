# Code migrated to [GitHub](https://github.com/gueei/AndroidBinding) #

## What? ##

Activity in Android environment is too overload. It act as the communication between android core system, to application flow control and also dealing with visual system. This project aims to provide a framework to enable data-binding between view widgets to separate data model. Idea basically sits on Windows WPF binding model, and help separation of MVC or MVVM easier in android development.

Demo Application is Up in market, you can search "Android Binding Demo" in Market.
